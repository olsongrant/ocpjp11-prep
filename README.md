# ocpjp11-prep
Some code and some notes that I wrote in the process of preparing and reflecting on the Oracle Java 11 certification.

Not all of the code compiles, and the choice of not fixing the problems is deliberate. The Oracle Java 11 exam asks candidates to recognize whether a sample of code compiles or not, and it asks them sometimes to know exactly which line is the culprit. And sometimes, the easiest way to show what doesn't compile is to leave the bad code intact.
