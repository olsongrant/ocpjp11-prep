PrintWriter, PrintStream, Console

PrintWriter construction:
 definitely many constructors
 constructor arg types include 
   File, OutputStream, Writer, Charset, and String
    the String items can be fileNames or charsetNames

PrintWriter methods:
void flush()
void close()
boolean checkError()
protected void setError()	
protected void clearError()
void write(<a variety of things>)
void print(<a variety of things>)
void println(<a variety of things>)
PrintWriter printf(String format, Object... args)
PrintWriter printf(Locale l, String format, Object... args)
PrintWriter format(String format, Object... args)
PrintWriter format(Locale l, String format, Object... args)
Printwriter append(CharSequence)
PrintWriter append(CharSequence, startInt, endInt)
PrintWriter append(char)

Format strings (used by PrintWriter): 
 these are the ones with %d, %f, %s, etc.
 
PrintStream 
is very, very similar to PrintWriter
apparently, the difference is that PrintStream writes bytes, whereas the PrintWriter writes characters

System.console() returns a Console

a Console is not a PrintWriter or a PrintStream
Console does have a writer() method that returns a PrintWriter, however
And it has a reader() method that returns a Reader object
closing the writer doesn't close the underlying stream
closing the reader doesn't close the underlying stream
