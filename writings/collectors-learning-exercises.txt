Collectors learning exercises

Given an encapsulated Book class with a title, author, and a price, and a list of Book objects, use a stream to calculate the average price of the books in the List.

Double avgPrice = bookList.stream().collect(Collectors.averagingDouble(b->b.getPrice()));

Now calculate the average length of the titles of the books in the list.

Double avgLength = bookList.stream().collect(Collectors.averagingInt(b->b.getTitle().length()));

There's also averagingLong

A use of collectingAndThen:
Integer numberOver10Bucks = Book.sampleBookList().stream().collect(
				Collectors.collectingAndThen(
				Collectors.filtering(
						b->b.getPrice()>10.0, 
						Collectors.toList()), 
						aList->aList.size()));
						


summarizingDouble with the list of books:
DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = Book.sampleBookList().stream()
				.collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(b->b.getPrice()));
		System.out.println(stats);
