Lambdas

Rules regarding the writing of lambdas:
1. can omit the data type of the parameters
2. if only one parameter, can omit the parentheses
3. must have the arrow token, ->
4. For the body, 
   * if you use a return, then you must use braces and a semicolon (must use a proper block)
   * if you specify a single expression, the return is implied
   * you don't have to enclose a void method invocation in braces
   local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final
   
Use of lambdas:
Can only use lambda expressions in situations in which the Java compiler can determine a target type:
  * variable declarations
  * assignments
  * return statements
  * array initializers
  * method or constructor arguments
  * lambda expression bodies
  * conditional expressions, ternary operators
  * cast expressions
