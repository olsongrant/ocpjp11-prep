Permissions, AccessController, AccessControlContext

Permission objects are organized into PermissionCollection groupings.
The java.security.Permissions class represents a collection of PermissionCollections.

// an example of no permissions
private static final java.security.PermissionCollection
    noPermissions = new java.security.Permissions();
	
each class has a ProtectionDomain

uses intersection of permissions of each stack frame

AccessController.doPrivileged cuts off the stack check

Be careful when using caller-provided data/objects

Do not leak sensitive data objects

null AccessControlContext = full permissions

there's a way to add a parameter for the exact permission that is needed for the doPrivileged
