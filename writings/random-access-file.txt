RandomAccessFile

java.io.RandomAccessFile extends java.lang.Object  (Notice that it does not extend InputStream or OutputStream classes).
All Implemented Interfaces: Closeable, DataInput, DataOutput, AutoCloseable

The following JavaDoc API description of RandomAccessFile tells you all that you need to know: 

It allows you  to read as well as write to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor, or index into the implied array, called the file pointer; input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available; output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be extended. The file pointer can be read by the getFilePointer method and set by the seek method.

It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been read, an EOFException (which is a kind of IOException) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for any reason other than end-of-file, an IOException other than EOFException is thrown. In particular, an IOException may be thrown if the stream has been closed.

Potential modes:
"r" -- read
"rw" -- read and write
"rwd" -- force to write immediately to the storage device, except the metadata
"rws" -- force to write immediately to the storage device, including metadata
